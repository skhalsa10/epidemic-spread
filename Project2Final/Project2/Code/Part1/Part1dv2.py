"""
Written by Siri Khalsa

The goal of this is create a population of covid-19 spikes
every iteration it will randomly mutate.
if the spike is still in the neutral network after the mutation it stays around
if it is no longer in the neutral network than the virus will die and a 
new covid-19 spike will be generated in its place

It will run till a number of SARS or other final virus is found. it will then 
output the statistics of the run.
