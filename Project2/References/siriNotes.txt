My guesses on how the following are related to the coronavirus:

•Top down vs bottom up causality
	- the thing I can think of is that after the epidemic spread to enough people, people started to change the way they behaved. sports events are being canceled or being played without fans. people are canceling their travel plans. 

•Logistic map (and chaotic population dynamics)
	- can we use to think about a population that is being infected for example r could equal birth of an infected person - death of that person or recovery of that person?
	-should we think about a virus livintg on the edge of chaos? the logistic map showcases points where we have a stable sections right before chaos. A virus may have the potential to live somewhere inbetween these two extremes.  for example, as it mutaates it is living in the chaotic reagion where it is mutating all over the place trying desperately to find a state that it can be stable. when it does the strain has successfuly found a state that allows it to spread at which point it becomes stable.

•Frozen accidents
	- The geneitic code idea is thought to be a Frozen accident. and our complex life seems to be built around it.
•Measures of complexity
	- how is this related?
•Neutral networks
	- I am still a little confused on this.
•Epidemic spread
	-obviously covid-19 is definitely in an epidemic spread

questions I have after reading
	- a virus that originates say with bats or whatever. Does it kill the bat like it does to humans?
