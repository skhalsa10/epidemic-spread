1a. Assuming the covid-19 RNA is 30,000 nucleotides long, how many RNA strands of the same length
are exactly 1 mutation away?

n = 30,000
k = number of mutations
we have 4 types of nucleotides but since we are in a state already we can only change to 3 other ones.

The formula for how many possibilities are k mutations away is :
3^k* n choose k = 3^k*n!/k!(n-k)!

the total amount of possible mutations is the SUM of this from k = 0 to n

1b

Calculate the total number of possible combinations of nucleotides and the number of possible amino
acids from these 15 nucleotides and 5 amino acids. NOTE: ignore position 1, only consider 2 – 6.

answer is 4^15

Calculate the number of genomes 1, 2, 3, all the way up to 15 mutations away from a length 15 genome.
Show these in some sort of figure. A log scale may be helpful.

use the application I built

Calculate the minimum number of mutations required for the current spike protein to become
equivalent to the SARS-2002 spike protein that was much more lethal. Assume that Bedford’s blog is
correct, and on average 1 of the 30,000 nucleotides mutates per transmission, and that is on average
once per 7 days. Ignore neutral networks for a moment, and predict how likely the virus is to generate
any one of the 5 mutations required to revert back to the SARS spike protein. Comment on how one
would calculate the likelihood that all of those mutations would happen at once, and how long that
might take.

first the minimum  will just be the minimum to get from LFQQN to YLNYT

using the weel I know the following:

    L->Y = 2 mutations
    F->L = 1 mutation
    Q->N = 2 mutations
    Q->Y = 2 mutations
    N->T = 1 mutation

    total minimum = 8


for this part of the question: 

Assume that Bedford’s blog is correct, and on average 1 of the 30,000 nucleotides mutates per transmission,
and that is on average once per 7 days. Ignore neutral networks for a moment, and predict how likely 
the virus is to generate any one of the 5 mutations required to revert back to the SARS spike protein. 
Comment on how one would calculate the likelihood that all of those mutations would happen at once, and 
how long that might take.

first based on above this should be 8 mutations not 5. should ask this as a question confirm.

second the chance for ay one of these to happen if any of the 30000 nucleotides are equally likely to mutate
would by 8/30000

now if the world alligned perfectly  8 mutations in a row happened and they were the exact mutations to make the original SARS
than the probability of that would be (8/30000)^8 and it would take on average 7 days per mutation. 

it would take 8 weeks.
